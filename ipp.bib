abstract = {Chemotactic bacteria are guided towards the source of a nutrient by local concentration gradients. That works on the microscopic scale, but at larger scales such local cues are unreliable pointers for example, wind or water currents may disperse odours sought by foraging animals. Using statistical techniques, Vergassola et al. have developed a general search algorithm for movement strategies based on the detection of sporadic cues and partial information. The strategy, termed 'infotaxis' as it maximizes the expected rate of information gain, could find application in the design of 'sniffer' robots.},

abstract = {Robotic sampling is attractive in many field robotics applications that require persistent collection of physical samples for ex-situ analysis. Examples abound in the earth sciences in studies involving the collection of rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. In our test domain, marine ecosystem monitoring, detailed understanding of plankton ecology requires laboratory analysis of water samples, but predictions using physical and chemical properties measured in real-time by sensors aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can guide sample collection decisions. In this paper, we present a data-driven and opportunistic sampling strategy to minimize cumulative regret for batches of plankton samples acquired by an AUV over multiple surveys. Samples are labeled at the end of each survey, and used to update a probabilistic model that guides sampling during subsequent surveys. During a survey, the AUV makes irrevocable sample collection decisions online for a sequential stream of candidates,...},

@article{Hollinger2014,
abstract = {We propose three sampling-based motion planning algorithms for generating informative mobile robot trajectories. The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e.g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives.

We consider a greedy algorithm and a 2-matching based algorithm, and we show that they have approximation factors of 12+$\kappa$ and max{\{}23(2+$\kappa$),23(1−$\kappa$){\}} respectively, where $\kappa$ is the curvature of the submodular function. Both algorithms require a number of calls to the submodular function that is cubic to the number of vertices in the graph. We then present a method to solve a multi-objective optimization consisting of both additive edge costs and submodular edge rewards. We provide simulation results to empirically evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate an application in monitoring an environment using an autonomous mobile sensor, where the sensing reward is related to the entropy reduction of a given set of measurements.},

abstract = {—We propose an information-theoretic planning ap-proach that enables mobile robots to autonomously construct dense 3D maps in a computationally efficient manner. Inspired by prior work, we accomplish this task by formulating an information-theoretic objective function based on the Cauchy-Schwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) that guides robots to obtain measurements in uncertain regions of the map. We propose a two stage planning approach. First, we generate a candidate set of trajectories using a combination of global planning and generation of local motion primitives. From this set, we choose a trajectory that maximizes the information-theoretic objective. Second, we employ a gradient-based trajectory opti-mization technique to locally refine the chosen trajectory such that the CSQMI objective is maximized while satisfying the robot's motion constraints. We evaluated our approach through a series of simulations and experiments on a ground robot and an aerial robot mapping unknown 3D environments. Real-world experiments suggest our approach reduces the time to explore an environment by 70{\%} compared to a closest frontier exploration strategy and 57{\%} compared to an information-based strategy that uses global planning, while simulations demonstrate the approach extends to aerial robots with higher-dimensional state.},

One of the challenges associated with extending such methods to real-time brain imaging is the need for adequate stopping criteria, an aspect of Bayesian optimization which has received limited attention. In light of high scanning costs and limited attentional capacities of subjects an accurate and reliable stopping criteria is essential.

abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Robotic science missions in remote environments, such as deep ocean and outer space, can involve studying phenomena that cannot directly be observed using on-board sensors but must be deduced by combining measurements of correlated variables with domain knowledge. Traditionally, in such missions, robots passively gather data along prescribed paths, while inference, path planning, and other high level decision making is largely performed by a supervisory science team. However, communication constraints hinder these processes, and hence the rate of scientific progress. This paper presents an active perception approach that aims to reduce robots' reliance on human supervision and improve science productivity by encoding scientists' domain knowledge and decision making process on-board. We use Bayesian networks to compactly model critical aspects of scientific knowledge while remaining robust to observation and modeling uncertainty. We then formulate path planning and sensor scheduling as an information gain maximization problem, and propose a sampling-based solution based on Monte Carlo tree search to plan informative sensing actions which exploit the knowledge encoded in the network. The computational complexity of our framework does not grow with the number of observations taken and allows long horizon planning in an anytime manner, making it highly applicable to field robotics. Simulation results show statistically significant performance improvements over baseline methods, and we validate the practicality of our approach through both hardware experiments and simulated experiments with field data gathered during the NASA Mojave Volatiles Prospector science expedition.},

abstract = {A new method for Feature Subset Selection in machine learning, FSS-EBNA (Feature Subset Selection by Estimation of Bayesian Network Algorithm), is presented. FSS-EBNA is an evolutionary, population-based, randomized search algorithm, and it can be executed when domain knowledge is not available. A wrapper approach, over Naive-Bayes and ID3 learning algorithms, is used to evaluate the goodness of each visited solution. FSS-EBNA, based on the EDA (Estimation of Distribution Algorithm) paradigm, avoids the use of crossover and mutation operators to evolve the populations, in contrast to Genetic Algorithms. In absence of these operators, the evolution is guaranteed by the factorization of the probability distribution of the best solutions found in a generation of the search. This factorization is carried out by means of Bayesian networks. Promising results are achieved in a variety of tasks where domain knowledge is not available. The paper explains the main ideas of Feature Subset Selection, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and Bayesian networks, presenting related work about each concept. A study about the `overfitting' problem in the Feature Subset Selection process is carried out, obtaining a basis to define the stopping criteria of the new algorithm.},

abstract = {Submodularity 1 is a property of set functions with deep theoretical consequences and far– reaching applications. At first glance it appears very similar to concavity, in other ways it resembles convexity. It appears in a wide variety of applications: in Computer Science it has recently been identified and utilized in domains such as viral marketing (Kempe et al., 2003), information gathering (Krause and Guestrin, 2007), image segmentation (Boykov and Jolly, 2001; Kohli et al., 2009; Jegelka and Bilmes, 2011a), document summarization (Lin and Bilmes, 2011), and speeding up satisfiability solvers (Streeter and Golovin, 2008). In this survey we will introduce submodularity and some of its generalizations, illustrate how it arises in various applications, and discuss algorithms for optimizing submodular functions. Our emphasis here is on maximization; there are many important results and applications related to minimizing submodular functions that we do not cover 2 . As a concrete running example, we will consider the problem of deploying sensors in a drinking water distribution network (see Figure 1) in order to detect contamination. In this domain, we may have a model of how contaminants, accidentally or maliciously introduced into the network, spread over time. Such a model then allows to quantify the benefit f (A) of deploying sensors at a particular set A of locations (junctions or pipes in the network) in terms of the detection performance (such as average time to detection). Based on this notion of utility, we then wish to find an optimal subset A ⊆ V of locations maximizing the utility, max A f (A), subject to some constraints (such as bounded cost). This application requires solving a difficult real-world optimization problem, that can be handled with the techniques discussed in this chapter (Krause et al. 2008b show in detail how submodular optimization can be applied in this domain.) We will also discuss more complex settings, for example how one can incorporate complex constraints on the feasible sets A, robustly optimize against adversarially chosen objective functions f , or adaptively select sensors based on previous observations. Several algorithms for submodular optimization described in this survey are implemented in an open source Matlab toolbox 3 (Krause, 2010).},

abstract = {In contrast to classic geometric motion planning, informative path planning (IPP) seeks a path for a robot to sense the world and gain information. In adaptive IPP, the robot chooses the next sensing location conditioned on all information acquired so far, and the robot's goal is to minimize the travel cost required for identifying a true hypothesis. Adaptive IPP is NP-hard, because the robot must trade-off information gain and travel cost optimally. In this paper we present Recursive Adaptive Identification (RAId), a new polynomial-time approximation algorithm for adaptive IPP. We prove a polylogarithmic approximation bound when the robot travels in a metric space. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that RAId is practical and provides good approximate solutions for two distinct robot planning tasks. Although RAId is designed primarily for noiseless observations, a simple extension allows it to handle some tasks with noisy observations.},

abstract = {The labor-intensive task of labeling data is a serious bottleneck for many supervised learning approaches for natural language processing applications. Active learning aims to reduce the human labeling cost for supervised learning methods. Determining when to stop the active learning process is a very important practical issue in real-world applications. This article addresses the stopping criterion issue of active learning, and presents four simple stopping criteria based on confidence estimation over the unlabeled data pool, including maximum uncertainty, overall uncertainty, selected accuracy, and minimum expected error methods. Further, to obtain a proper threshold for a stopping criterion in a specific task, this article presents a strategy by considering the label change factor to dynamically update the predefined threshold of a stopping criterion during the active learning process. To empirically analyze the effectiveness of each stopping criterion for active learning, we design several comparison experiments on seven real-world datasets for three representative natural language processing applications such as word sense disambiguation, text classification and opinion analysis.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

Per-sistent collection of physical water samples can be improved by automation. Robotic sampling makes it possible to strategically collect water samples based on real-time measurements of phys-ical and chemical properties gathered with onboard sensors. In this paper, we present a multi-robot, data-driven, water-sampling strategy, where autonomous surface vehicles plan and execute water sampling using the chlorophyll density as a cue for plankton-rich water samples. We use two Autonomous Surface Vehicles, one equipped with a water quality sensor and the other equipped with a physical water-sampling apparatus. The robot with sensors acts as an explorer, measuring and building a spatial map of chlorophyll density in the given region of interest. The robot equipped with water sampling apparatus makes decisions in real-time on where to sample the water, based on the suggestions made by the explorer robot. We evaluate our system in simulation and on real robots in an actual drinking-water reservoir, showing the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

Our approach is evaluated on the application of weed detection for precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an occupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to information-theoretic objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our approach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the effects of different planning strategies.

abstract = {This paper presents a technique for adaptively tracking$\backslash$nbathymetric contours using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)$\backslash$nequipped with a single altimeter sonar. An adaptive feature mapping$\backslash$nbehavior is developed to address the problem of how to locate and track$\backslash$nfeatures of unknown extent in an environment where a priori information$\backslash$nis unavailable. This behavior is implemented as part of the layered$\backslash$ncontrol architecture used by the AUV Odyssey II. The new adaptive$\backslash$nfeature mapping behavior builds on previous work in layered control by$\backslash$nincorporating planning and mapping capabilities that allow the vehicle$\backslash$nto alter its trajectory online in response to sensor data in order to$\backslash$ntrack contour features. New waypoints are selected by evaluating the$\backslash$nexpected utility of visiting a given location balanced against the$\backslash$nexpected cost of traveling to a particular cell. The technique is$\backslash$ndeveloped assuming sensor input in the form of a single, narrow-beam$\backslash$naltimeter sensor attached to a non-holonomic, dynamically controlled$\backslash$nsurvey-class AUV such as the Odyssey II. Simulations of the Charles$\backslash$nRiver basin which have been constructed from real bathymetry data are$\backslash$nused as test missions. The 7-m contour line of a prominent trench in the$\backslash$nriver serves as the target feature. The adaptive contour following$\backslash$nbehavior tracks the contour despite navigation error and environmental$\backslash$ndisturbances, supplying the capability of autonomously detecting and$\backslash$nfollowing distinctive bathymetric features using a point sensor.

We prove theoretical upper bounds on the regret with batches of size K for this procedure which show the improvement of the order of ? K for fixed iteration cost over purely sequential versions.

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze an intuitive Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal in- formation gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

abstract = {Bayesian Optimisation has received considerable attention in recent years as a general methodol- ogy to find the maximum of costly-to-evaluate objective functions. Most existing BO work fo- cuses on where to gather a set of samples with- out giving special consideration to the sampling sequence, or the costs or constraints associated with that sequence. However, in real-world sequential decision problems such as robotics, the order in which samples are gathered is paramount, especially when the robot needs to optimise a temporally non-stationary objective function. Additionally, the state of the environ- ment and sensing platform determine the type and cost of samples that can be gathered. To address these issues, we formulate Sequential Bayesian Optimisation (SBO) with side-state in- formation within a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework that can accommodate discrete and continuous observa- tion spaces. We build on previous work using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Upper Confidence bound for Trees (UCT) for POMDPs and extend it to work with continuous state and observation spaces. Through a series of experi- ments on monitoring a spatial-temporal process with a mobile robot, we show that our UCT- based SBO POMDP optimisation outperforms myopic and non-myopic alternatives. 1},

We propose UCB style algorithms that are popular in the bandit settings and show how those analyses can be adapted to the online robotic path planning problems. The proposed algorithm trades-off exploration and exploitation in near-optimal manner and has appealing no-regret properties.

One difficulty with this view is that a scientist typically does not have, nor can be normally expected to have, a clear idea of the utility of his results. An alternative is to design an experiment to maximize the expected information to be gained from it. In this paper we show that the latter view is a special case of the former with an appropriate choice of the decision space and a reasonable constraint on the utility function.

abstract="For large state-space Markovian Decision Problems Monte-Carlo planning is one of the few viable approaches to find near-optimal solutions. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives.",
